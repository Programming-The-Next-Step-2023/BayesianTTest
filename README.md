# BayesianTTest
An interactive GUI to perform Bayesian t-tests.

The calculations are performed with the R package BayesFactor, and are implemented into a Shiny dashboard which allows for visualization of prior and posterior distributions.

Single sample, dependent sample and independent sample t-tests are available.
